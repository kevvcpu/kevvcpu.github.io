                <h1>About me!</h1>
                <p>I'm a passionate tech enthusiast working toward a future in cybersecurity. I fell in love with technology the first time I saw a laptop, and that curiosity has only grown. Although I'm still building my skills, I'm committed to learning and improving every day. I've overcome personal challenges and I'm rebuilding positive habits to focus on growth. Right now I'm studying HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL to prepare for projects ahead. I'm 16 years old, and I believe it's never too late to start pursuing your goals.</p>
