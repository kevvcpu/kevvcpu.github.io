                <h1>About me!</h1>
                <p>I’m a passionate tech enthusiast working toward a future in cybersecurity. I fell in love with technology the first time I saw a laptop, and that curiosity has only grown.<br> Although I’m still building my skills, I’m committed to learning and improving every day. I’ve overcome personal challenges like addiction and low motivation, and I’m rebuilding positive habits so I can focus on growth. Right now I’m studying HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL to prepare for a project planned next year. I’m 16 years old, and I believe it’s never too late to start pursuing your goals.</p>
